        <h3>Bacon and Eggs from Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
        <p>Howl's Moving Castle is a magical movie with even more fantastical looking food. With Calcifer's blazing flame, let us learn how to make Howl's bacon and eggs!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 slices thick cut bacon</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>fresh bread</li>
            <li>white cheddar</li>
            <li>kosher salt</li>
            <li>coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium low and fry strips of bacon. This will keep the bacon from burning while the fat renders out. Flip halfway.</li>
            <li>Once the fat is rendered out, add 4 cracked eggs to the pan. Cook until the eggs have a nice crust on them. If the egg whites need to cook more, kill Calcifer and cover with a lid to steam the top of the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Remove the bacon from the skillet and pat with a paper towel to remove excess grease.</li>
            <li>Cut the bread to your desired thickness and toast in the skillet until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Slice the white cheddar to desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Serve the bacon and eggs with the toast and cheese and season with salt and pepper. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
